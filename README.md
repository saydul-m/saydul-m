<p dir="auto">My occupation is IT Technician. Currently, I am actively engaged in a 12-week intensive digital skills bootcamp in data with JUST IT Training, where my focus is on honing my expertise in key tools and programming languages essential for a data analyst role. Throughout the program, I have gained practical proficiency in Excel, SQL, Python, R, Tableau, and PowerBI, each serving as a valuable addition to my data analytics toolkit. This comprehensive training has not only equipped me with technical skills but has also fostered a genuine passion for developing and applying these capabilities as a data analyst. I find great satisfaction in unraveling the insights within datasets and using these tools to drive informed decision-making.</p>
